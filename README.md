# JavaScript skeleton

A skeleton repository for new JavaScript projects on GitHub. Mainly for open
source npm packages, but can be adjusted for different purposes.

_Meta: This README itself can be used as a seed for new project's README._

## Getting Started

Copy this repository (without git history):

```
npx degit lttr/js-skeleton new-project
```

### Prerequisites

nodejs >= 10

### Usage

There is a lot included. Remove files that you don't need for your project.

Replace all example values.

Take advantage of built in scripts.

The default purpose is publishing an open source npm package. You need to adjust
for different purposes.

## Topics covered by this repository skeleton

### Project name and short description

Project name as well as a short description is reflected in repo name, in README
and in package.json.

### Readme

From readme you should be able to quickly find out what is the project aiming
for, what is the current status and how you can install, run or modify the
project.

### Formatting, linting and code style

To reduce unnecessary discussions and improve uniformity of a code base it is
great to have an automatic formatter. For JavaScript ecosystem this is
`prettier`. Some really basic formatting rules for editors are set in
`editorconfig` (prettier preserves them).

For checking code style (but not formatting in this case), there is `eslint`.
